# vacant_seat_finder
A smart rail assistant that solves the waitlist problem by detecting "hidden" vacancies between intermediate stations. It stitches together multiple partial confirmed tickets (e.g., Seat 72 for A->B, Seat 15 for B->C) to guarantee a complete journey when direct tickets are unavailable.
